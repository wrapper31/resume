Duration:  Feb 2018 - April 2019
          Description – 
Currently Working on Existing KeyView Deluxe application which is used to store
Customer loan/mortgage documents. KVD is basically used for ALS team to store the content regarding a customer when customer detail is created.

Once a final approval is taken on the selection of the customer and after he signs the document then the documents gets dispatched to key centers where loan issuing team scan these documents and loads into KVD. It acts as a driving force for overall business process. When the customer loan application is approved the singed documents are sent for scanning . Each document is assigned a barcode. Scanner reads the barcode and stores the document details to Filenet by auto indexing them. In case there is any error in reading in barcode then it sends to manual indexing using export module and then the documents are store manually to FileNet server.

Project:       SRTS – Service Request tracking System 

Duration:     May 2016 – Feb 2017	
Description –The Keycorp Service Request Tracking system is an interactive application which is built over IBM BPM , Microsoft Web socket and mainframe technology. This system is being used by call center representatives or back office agents to validate advance and payment requests.  The validation happens on ream time while customer is on call with call center representative through this system which is integrated which with integrated workspace system. The key representative uses this application to do the validation over CLS which is a mainframe system that runs locally on their system and the SRTS which is web-based system sends the request using web socket technology to invoke a screen scrapping client which runs over the CLS screen and feed the data back as a response to the caller in real time and reduces the service level agreement by couple of days to minutes.  Initially these requests used to be routed through back office channel for verification and validation and then routed back to the representative who raised the request on behalf of the client. By using this system, the key representatives are faster in validation, Approval and fraud detection if any.

Description: Standing Order Processing (SCaP) is a process to be automated to serve the customer in better way.
Existing process implementation doesn’t allow the BCBS  to communicate the customer in quick way if any of the details are missing as part of the mandate. BCBS wanted to  have the Agents to have single interface to complete all the activities related to SCaP with minimal effort. The claiming process agents would also like to have the business rules associated with SCaP setup as part of the system rather than with member agents and automate the process to avoid human errors. BPM based process implementation provides the agents to have single interface to complete the SCP setup rather than using different systems to perform different activities related to SCaP setup process, which saves the time and effort of the agent and also provides the better way of handling business exceptions as we have the entire data as part of the BPM.
